In Person: I can meet 30 minutes prior to class if you coordinate with me prior to the day of class.  I can also stick around for questions up to 30 minutes after class.

In Email: Anytime, however I may not be able to respond immediately.  I will target responding within 48 hours.

Course Prerequisites
This is a BYOD course.  Students must provide and bring to class a laptop capable of running multiple Virtual Machines simultaneously.  (Chromebooks and iPads are not acceptable)  Please bring a system with at least 8 GB of RAM and 50-100 GB of available Hard Disk Space.

Completion of CYBR 620, 623, and 650 is encouraged. Strong Microsoft Windows knowledge (familiarity with the Unix command line helpful), and a solid understanding of general computing and networking are required.  At least one year of practical IT industry experience (or equivalent) is strongly recommended.   Course enrollment restricted to CYBR MPS students; others may enroll on a permission-only basis if qualified and space is available.

Course Description
This interactive hands-on course will provide an introduction to computer and network technical incident handling and forensics activities.  Topics include disk and file system imaging and forensics, packet capture and analysis, basic malware examination, log file analysis, analysis of volatile data (such as RAM), the incident handling process, and more.  Tools used include Wireshark, tcpdump, Network Miner, FTK Imager, SleuthKit/Autopsy, SQLiteSpy, Bless hex editor, Snort, aircrack-ng suite, and many more.   

Overall Course Objectives
•	Define Incident Response Process
•	Prepare a Cyber Security Forensics Report
•	How to respond to a compromised system
•	Analysis of volatile data, such as RAM
•	Perform malware analysis
•	Describe Incident Response Process and Computer Forensics concepts
•	Imaging live acquisition and dead acquisition of hard drives

	•	Collect and analyze logs of compromised systems
•	Analyze network traffic and find malicious traffic
•	Examine anomalous traffic using various tools
•	Explain how a system is compromised
•	Establish a guideline to prevent future attacks

Course Work
Hands on Labs
Each class will conclude with a lab in order to practice the topic discussed in a technical, hands on fashion.

Exams
There will be two exams, a midterm and a final, designed to reinforce the topics discussed throughout the semester in order to promote retention of the information.

Project
There will be one project in which a paper will be delivered and a presentation will be provided to the class.  The project can be worked in teams of no more than 5 individuals.  

Assignment:  Discuss a recent cyber incident/attack by researching news articles covering the incident.  Outline the attack, the incident response from the organization attacked and associated forensics, any indicators of compromise, the recovery time, and end-user impact.  This project will serve as a real-life anchor to reflect on as we discuss the topics each week throughout the course.  

If you choose an incident that is too recent, you may have trouble finding sources that answer all of the areas above.  In instances like this, you can develop fictitious scenarios to help fill in the blanks that aren’t fully answered in your research, however the scenarios must be grounded in your research.

Writing and Research
Effective writing is critical to the intellectual life of university students and graduates within the workplace. Effective managers are usually effective communicators. Your work in this course must demonstrate your ability to master and effectively communicate course content. Effective writing:
•	Meets the needs of the reader
•	Adequately covers the subject
•	Uses expected conventions of format and organizations
•	Demonstrates use of credible reasoning and evidence
•	Satisfies standards of style and grammatical correctness
•	Requires 100% compliance with UMBC's zero-tolerance policy regarding plagiarism. 

Academic Integrity 
By enrolling is this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UMBC’s scholarly community in which everyone’s academic work and behavior and held to the highest standards of honesty.  Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and helping others to commit these acts are all forms of academic dishonesty, and they are wrong.  Academic misconduct could result in disciplinary action that may include, but is not limited to, suspension or dismissal.  To find useful information about avoiding plagiarism infractions through appropriate citations, or to read the full policy regarding student academic misconduct for the graduate school, please see http://www.umbc.edu/provost/integrity. 

Course Policies
•	   Incomplete grades will not be entertained unless extenuating circumstances warrant and your request is made before 1 December. If you don't inform me of any situations that distract you from your work in this class, I can't try to "work with you" and must grade you accordingly. (Incomplete requests may not always be granted.)

•	   Final papers submitted after the deadline (but within 24 hours) will receive an automatic one-grade deduction unless an extension has been agreed to in advance. Beyond 24 hours, zero credit will be given.  Emergency situations will be handled on a case by case basis with appropriate justification, coordination, and/or documentation.   

•	   Failure to follow guidelines for the final paper format, style, length, submission, etc. may result in at least a one-letter-grade reduction on the paper depending on the type and/or number of transgressions. Yes, this may be severe, but you are graduate students and expected to both follow instructions and meet posted expectations.

•	   Referencing and citations should conform to the APA style guide unless you are dealing with highly technical topics – in such cases, feel free to use ACM style. Do not use footnotes or endnotes.  

•	   Any ADA or documented special needs must be brought to my attention during the first week of the semester, and proper university documentation must be provided.  Retroactive accommodations may not be accepted.

•	  If there are any questions, consult the syllabus and course materials first.  If you still have concerns/questions, feel free to contact me.  E-mail responses on class items normally occur within 48 hours, not including weekends, breaks, holidays, other declared times.

Disclosures of Sexual Misconduct and Child Abuse or Neglect
As an instructor, I am considered a Responsible Employee, per UMBC’s Policy on Prohibited Sexual Misconduct, Interpersonal Violence, and Other Related Misconduct (located at http://humanrelations.umbc.edu/sexual-misconduct/umbc-resource-page-for-sexual-misconduct-and-other-related-misconduct/). While my goal is for you to be able to share information related to your life experiences through discussion and written work, I want to be transparent that as a Responsible Employee I am required to report disclosures of sexual assault, domestic violence, relationship violence, stalking, and/or gender-based harassment to the University’s Title IX Coordinator.
As an instructor, I also have a mandatory obligation to report disclosures of or suspected instances of child abuse or neglect (www.usmh.usmd.edu/regents/bylaws/SectionVI/VI150.pdf).
The purpose of these reporting requirements is for the University to inform you of options, supports and resources; you will not be forced to file a report with the police. Further, you are able to receive supports and resources, even if you choose to not want any action taken. Please note that in certain situations, based on the nature of the disclosure, the University may need to take action.
