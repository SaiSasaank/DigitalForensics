CYBR 642 – Intro to Digital Forensics

Semester: Fall 2019

Course Description
This interactive hands-on course will provide an introduction to computer and network technical incident handling and forensics activities.  Topics include disk and file system imaging and forensics, packet capture and analysis, basic malware examination, log file analysis, analysis of volatile data (such as RAM), the incident handling process, and more.  Tools used include Wireshark, tcpdump, Network Miner, FTK Imager, SleuthKit/Autopsy, SQLiteSpy, Bless hex editor, Snort, aircrack-ng suite, and many more.   

Overall Course Objectives
•	Define Incident Response Process
•	Prepare a Cyber Security Forensics Report
•	How to respond to a compromised system
•	Analysis of volatile data, such as RAM
•	Perform malware analysis
•	Describe Incident Response Process and Computer Forensics concepts
•	Imaging live acquisition and dead acquisition of hard drives
•	Collect and analyze logs of compromised systems
•	Analyze network traffic and find malicious traffic
•	Examine anomalous traffic using various tools
•	Explain how a system is compromised
•	Establish a guideline to prevent future attacks

Course Work
Hands on Labs
Each class will conclude with a lab in order to practice the topic discussed in a technical, hands on fashion.

Exams
There will be two exams, a midterm and a final, designed to reinforce the topics discussed throughout the semester in order to promote retention of the information.

Project
There will be one project in which a paper will be delivered and a presentation will be provided to the class.  The project can be worked in teams of no more than 5 individuals.  

Assignment:  Discuss a recent cyber incident/attack by researching news articles covering the incident.  Outline the attack, the incident response from the organization attacked and associated forensics, any indicators of compromise, the recovery time, and end-user impact.  This project will serve as a real-life anchor to reflect on as we discuss the topics each week throughout the course.
